**Summary**

In this video, I will show you how to submit votes using a wallet. First, we need to connect the wallet. Then, we will select votes to submit, including positive, negative, and abstain. Once we are ready, we will connect the wallet and send the votes. We will sign the transaction, which is actually sending the sign data to the server. The votes will be processed by the sequencer, and settled on MINA. When done we can refresh the page to see that the tasks has been submitted. I will release this in about an hour or an hour and a half, so you can start voting if you decide to do so !
